## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy & Paste**  
   - Copy the entire text of the prompt above and paste it into your ChatGPT session.

2. **Adjust the Detail**  
   - If you want a deeper, more advanced explanation (e.g., high-level college biology), specify that in your query.  
   - If you want a more basic explanation (e.g., elementary level), let ChatGPT know so it can adjust the vocabulary and concepts.

3. **Run**  
   - Initiate your conversation and see how ChatGPT explains photosynthesis.

4. **Ask Follow-Up Questions**  
   - You can request additional details such as the impact of different light wavelengths, the Calvin cycle, or how environmental factors (like CO2 concentration) affect photosynthesis.  

5. **Verification**  
   - Always cross-reference the information provided by ChatGPT with reputable sources such as peer-reviewed articles or biology textbooks.

## Example Output (Excerpt)

> **ChatGPT**: *Photosynthesis is a process that plants, algae, and certain bacteria use to convert light energy from the Sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose...* (continues)

> **Common Misconceptions**:  
> 1. Photosynthesis only occurs during daylight (while some parts continue at night, such as respiration).  
> 2. Plants only produce oxygen (they also consume oxygen, but produce more than they use overall).
